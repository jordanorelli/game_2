This is an old project I did, just after graduating college.  I did it to learn
AS3, which, at that time, was still useful.  At the time I was convinced I
*had* to get into the games market.  Anywho, I'm not sure this can even be
built any more; I just put it up because I wanted to use the github source
browser to read it.  It may be handy if you're writing some AS3 and want to see
a basic game loop, but... it's really, really, really primitive, and I wrote it
before I had any real-world experience, so... it's pretty awful code, to be
honest.

A working version of the game can be found
[here](http://jordanorelli.com/media/flash/game_2.swf).  There's a known bug
where the enemy spawn rate doesn't reset after you die; if you go through a few
lives it becomes impossible very quickly.

oh and it's called game\_2 because it's the third time I wrote it.  game\_0 and
game\_1 are long gone.
